wb vs writeback
op1 vs operand1
read1/read2 vs ra/rb

TODO:
- Reconsider this signal naming convention... :)
- VGA output
- Memmory mapped character buffer for text console output
- USB UART would be awesome...
- USB HID via PS/2 emulation would be awesome...
- Command-line vivado usage???? Looks fairly awesome.  No more crazy directory structure.  Just src/*.sv ??

Next Steps:
1. Allow for arbitrary-time memory access / stalls
2. Switch to mix of BRAM & DDR
3. Move to design with unified memory, instruction/data caches, memory controller
