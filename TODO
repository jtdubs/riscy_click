Extensions:
- A - Atomics
- C - Compressed
- M - Multiplication & Division.  Will be multi-cycle.  Look at Non-restoring Division on wikipedia.

Future:
- I appear to have introduced a bug. I'm getting two if each character outputting...
- Implement Machine Level ISA... at least enough to get interrupts working...
- USB HID via PS/2 emulation would be awesome...
- USB UART would be awesome...
- Implement more of the Risc-V ISA
- Increase VGA resolution to 1280x1024?
- Allow for arbitrary-time memory access / stalls
- Switch to mix of BRAM & DDR
- Move to design with unified memory, instruction/data caches, memory controller
