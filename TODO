TODO:
- Tweak character rom params more, fonts are a bit blurry
- Try another font
- Can I bump up VGA res from 640x480 to something higher?  And increase font res?  Possibly 1280x1024??

Future:
- USB HID via PS/2 emulation would be awesome...
- USB UART would be awesome...
- Command-line vivado usage???? Looks fairly awesome.  No more crazy directory structure.  Just src/*.sv ??
- Allow for arbitrary-time memory access / stalls
- Switch to mix of BRAM & DDR
- Move to design with unified memory, instruction/data caches, memory controller
