TODO:
- custom types should be _t ??
- Does it work?  Currently, maybe??
- Naming convention for signals that handles the bypass / hazard signals better.  consider _i / _o...
- Check out the timing a bit harder

Steps:
1. Debug cycle counter?  Could put on board.
2. Allow for arbitrary-time memory access / stalls
3. Switch to mix of BRAM & DDR
4. Move to design with unified memory, instruction/data caches, memory controller

Video signals?
Keyboard/mouse signals?
USB signals?
Pipelining?
Switch from distributed memory to BRAM or DDR?
