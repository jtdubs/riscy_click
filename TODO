TODO:
- BIOS
    - Fix caps lock and shift handling
    - Add ALT+### to type extended keycodes
    - UART
- UART
    - How do I want to handle this in the simulator?  Feels like another window.
    - Flow Control
- PS/2
    - Full PS/2 driver including sending commands back to keyboard
    - PS/2 Mouse
- Audio output??
- Machine Level ISA
    - CSR
        - Decode should confirm address is read/executable, otherwise trap
        - Memory access should confirm address is read/write as appropriate
        - Expose chip select along with rwx.  Can use it externally to drive the dmem mux...
        - MTIME and MTIMECMP memory mapped registers??
        - Implement timers
- Memory
    - Allow for memory stalls
    - Add instruction & data cache
    - Add memory controller and DDR
- ISA Extensions
    - A - Atomics
    - C - Compressed
    - M - Multiplication & Division (multi-cycle)
- BIOS
    - Provide UART interface for loading an ELF and jumping to it
- CPU
    - Change stage breakdown or increase stages to up clock speed
