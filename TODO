TODO:
- Need a way to build a character rom from a font

Future:
- USB HID via PS/2 emulation would be awesome...
- USB UART would be awesome...
- Command-line vivado usage???? Looks fairly awesome.  No more crazy directory structure.  Just src/*.sv ??
- Allow for arbitrary-time memory access / stalls
- Switch to mix of BRAM & DDR
- Move to design with unified memory, instruction/data caches, memory controller
