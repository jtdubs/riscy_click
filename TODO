TODO:
- Debug
    - Trace should use register ABI names
    - Why does bios no longer clear the screen.  It works in -O2 * -O1, but not -O0
- Keyboard
    - FIFO signals become external interrupts
    - WFI instruction
    - Update BIOS to use interrupts to handle keyboard input
- Machine Level ISA
    - CSR
        - Decode should confirm address is read/executable, otherwise trap
        - Memory access should confirm address is read/write as appropriate
        - Expose chip select along with rwx.  Can use it externally to drive the dmem mux...
        - MTIME and MTIMECMP memory mapped registers??
- Peripherals
    - UART
- ISA Extensions
    - A - Atomics
    - C - Compressed
    - M - Multiplication & Division (multi-cycle)
- VGA
    - 1280x1024
- Memory
    - Allow for memory stalls
    - Add instruction & data cache
    - Add memory controller and DDR
- CPU
    - Change stage breakdown or increase stages to up clock speed
