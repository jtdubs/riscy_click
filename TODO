TODO:
- Verilator
    - Pull out Verilator folder that builds a static library
    - Sim and Trace can link it into their own projects
- CSR
    - Consider pulling CSR state machine out into it's own module to simplify ID
- Data Bus
    - Add specific read/write enable and/or chip-select for everything on the bus
    - Pull it all out into a separate module?
- Peripherals
    - UART
        - Get basic state machine working
        - Tx/Rx via pair of memory mapped FIFOs
        - Make UART configurable via memory mapped registers....
            - Enable/disable, baud rate, data bits, stop bits, parity, flow control, etc.
    - Full PS/2 driver including sending commands back to keyboard
    - PS/2 Mouse
- Interrupt Controller
    - Interrupt controller aggregates interrupts from external sources (keyboard, mouse, UART, etc.)
    - Interrupt controller has an mmap'd register for reading and clearing external interrupts
    - Interrupt controller has a single interrupt output that drives the Interrupt Pending CSR bit
- VGA
    - 1280x1024
- BIOS
    - Provide UART interface for loading an ELF and jumping to it
- Machine Level ISA
    - CSR
        - Decode should confirm address is read/executable, otherwise trap
        - Memory access should confirm address is read/write as appropriate
        - Expose chip select along with rwx.  Can use it externally to drive the dmem mux...
        - MTIME and MTIMECMP memory mapped registers??
- ISA Extensions
    - A - Atomics
    - C - Compressed
    - M - Multiplication & Division (multi-cycle)
- Memory
    - Allow for memory stalls
    - Add instruction & data cache
    - Add memory controller and DDR
- CPU
    - Change stage breakdown or increase stages to up clock speed
