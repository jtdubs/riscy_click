- Need to pull out a "board" w/ a CPU, RAM, ROM, etc.  Memory bus.  That sort of thing.
    - BIOS ROM is "instruction memory"
    - Memory bus is "data memory" for loads and stores
        - Contains block RAM
        - Contains memory mapped IO devices (e.g., 7seg displays, buttons, UART, ...)
- Get a RISCV compiler toolchain working so I can do BIOS development
- Write a trivial BIOS that reads from switches and outputs to 7seg display?
