TODO:
- Stages
    - Execute stage
    - Eventually consider extracting a bypass_queue type for use between stages...
    - Ideally a stage becomes:
        - Instantiate a combinational logic object for the stage
        - Instantiate a bypass queue for the outputs (inputs?  i think outputs.)
        - Stage inputs go to combinational logic from preceeding stages bypass queue
        - Combinational logic goes to bypass queue inputs
        - Bypass queue outputs are stage outputs
- PS2
    - Get working with real PS2 keyboard.
    - Apparently need to ACK the AA, therefore need PS2 Tx module and tri-state buffers
- UART
    - BIOS support
    - How do I want to handle this in the simulator?  Feels like another window.
    - Flow Control
- Memory
    - Add instruction & data cache
    - Add memory controller and DDR
- BIOS
    - Provide UART interface for loading an ELF and jumping to it
- ISA Extensions
    - M - Multiplication & Division (multi-cycle)
    - A - Atomics
- Machine Level ISA
    - CSR
        - Decode should confirm address is read/executable, otherwise trap
        - Memory access should confirm address is read/write as appropriate
        - Expose chip select along with rwx.  Can use it externally to drive the dmem mux...
        - MTIME and MTIMECMP memory mapped registers??
        - Implement timers
- PS/2
    - PS/2 Mouse
