TODO:
- Naming convention for signals that handles the bypass / hazard signals better.  consider _i / _o...
- Seems like it would currently runat 50MHz, analyze timing and shoot for 100MHz.
- Figure out how to use updatemem to replace the BIOS without having to re-run implementation

Next Steps:
1. Allow for arbitrary-time memory access / stalls
2. Switch to mix of BRAM & DDR
3. Move to design with unified memory, instruction/data caches, memory controller

Video signals?
Keyboard/mouse signals?
USB signals?
Pipelining?
Switch from distributed memory to BRAM or DDR?
